# JSF Authentication using JSF and Managed Beans

This project demonstrates how to implement authentication using JavaServer Faces (JSF) along with managed beans. Authentication is a crucial aspect of web applications to ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application.

## Technologies Used
- JavaServer Faces (JSF)
- Managed Beans
- Java EE (Enterprise Edition)

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Maven
- IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)
- Web Server (Apache Tomcat, WildFly, etc.)

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Make sure you have a web server installed and configured in your IDE.
4. Ensure that Maven dependencies are resolved.

## Usage
1. Run the application on your local server.
2. Access the login page through the browser.
